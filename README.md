# Car Inventory Module JavaScript Drill

---

## Project Overview

- This repository contains JavaScript ES Module scripts for searching and displaying car inventory data.

---

## Key features implemented include:

- Searching car details by ID (example: Car with ID 33),
- Importing and exporting data using ES6 modules,
- Separation of logic into problem scripts and test scripts,
- Organized code structure for modular development and testing,
- The scripts use only native JavaScript — no external libraries,
- All logic code is placed inside problem folder, and results are printed through test files.

---

## Installation & Requirements

- Install Node.js 18+

---

## Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

---

## How to Run

- Run any test file from the project root:

    - Example: 
        - run test script for Problem 1
        - node testproblem1.js
        - Replace testproblem1.js with any other test script such as testproblem2.js.

---

## All scripts follow the same pattern:

- problemX.js performs logic and exports results.

- testproblemX.js imports the result and prints output.

---

## Notes & Best Practices

- `.gitignore` prevents tracking of node_modules, build files, and OS-generated files.
